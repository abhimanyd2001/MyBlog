This project is a full stack web application.  The frontend is written in React, the backend in Express, and the data is stored in a relational database queried using SQLite.  The website was styled using CSS, while trying to maintain a minimal and clean looking page.

## About
This website is a blog website that houses some articles.  The original sources of the articles can be found below in the README file.  I did not write any of these articles.  

## Features
This project includes:

### Login Functionality
By hitting `Login/ Register`, you will be taken to the Login page.  To log in, enter your username and password.  If you haven't created an account yet you won't be able to log in and must hit the register button after entering a username and password.  If both of these haven't been taken, your info will be added to the database and you can log in.
