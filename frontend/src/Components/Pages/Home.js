                <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

                <p>The world of programming has come a long way.  We have an awesome community with creative projects and drastic progress.  With the 
                technology evolving so quickly, we can use a collaborative atmosphere like this blog to share ideas and innovate further.  Software engineering,
                web development, artificial intelligence, whatever you need!  Computer Science is about the experience, the learning, the journey, the progress, and at the end of the day
                it is about designing technologies to help others.  Technologies that can contribute something to society or make the users' lives easier.  Computer scientists are constantly 
                contributing to the changing culture and times, through new developments in libraries and packages, and even simple tips and tricks can go a long way to achieving or building a product in 
                a different manner.  
                </p>

                <p>Just to give a segway into what this website is, what is programming in the first place?  I like to think of programming as anything that makes your life easier through the form of 
                using technology to aid you.  There is an insane amount of software out there right now to make programming or an introduction to the topic as newbie-friendly as possible.  GUIs give us a beautiful interface
                and hide all the code underneath.  Take R Commander for example.  Allows us to make plots and graphs with simply the clicks of a few buttons.  For customization purposes we can still edit the
                markdown and the <em>R</em> language.
                </p>

                <p>A lot of times it is an enjoyable experience to simply build the small things in life, through side projects and personal projects.  Feel free to share some of your ideas and contributions here!
                This blog is about all things Computer Science.  A lot of the articles here aim to entertain, educate, and simply bring our community closer together.  A lot of our audience here is made up of college students and even people who find themselves interested
                in the field of Computer Science.  Hence, you don't have to be a CS Major or even in the field of Computer Science to get the most out of this website!  With programming and computer science so popular and coming full circle, we understand
                how essential coding is and how it can help automate literally anything that you don't feel like doing regularly!  This blog is for all of those people; students, adults, CS majors, non CS majors, and even if you are not human!
                For real, how cool would it be if sometime in the future, we made contact with aliens and this website was all they needed to know about how the Earth has come in terms of technological advancements!  We could even get some of the exterrestrial life to 
                contribute!  Anyways, I digress.  I hope you enjoy this blog site and make the most of it!  I wish you the best of luck in your CS (and non CS) endeavors!
